"Tokio" is a popular asynchronous runtime for building concurrent applications in Rust. It provides a set of tools, including an event loop, task scheduler, and various utilities, that enable developers to write efficient asynchronous code in Rust. However, it's important to note that Tokio is not a requirement for building async apps in Rust.

Rust itself has native support for asynchronous programming through its async and await syntax, which allows you to write asynchronous code using Rust's built-in std::future and std::task modules. With this native support, you can create asynchronous applications without relying on any external runtime like Tokio.

Tokio, on the other hand, offers a more feature-rich and optimized environment for asynchronous applications. It provides additional tools and abstractions that can make certain tasks easier to implement and optimize. It also has a large ecosystem of libraries and community support.

Tokio is not part of the Rust standard library, is developed and maintained by a dedicated group of open-source contributors and has become one of the most popular choices for building async applications in the Rust ecosystem.
